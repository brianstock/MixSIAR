Description: Creates and runs Bayesian mixing models to analyze
    biological tracer data (i.e. stable isotopes, fatty acids), which estimate the
    proportions of source (prey) contributions to a mixture (consumer). 'MixSIAR'
    is not one model, but a framework that allows a user to create a mixing model
    based on their data structure and research questions, via options for fixed/
    random effects, source data types, priors, and error terms. 'MixSIAR' incorporates
    several years of advances since 'MixSIR' and 'SIAR', and includes both GUI
    (graphical user interface) and script versions.
